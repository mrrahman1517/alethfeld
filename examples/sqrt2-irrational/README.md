## Theorem

**√2 is irrational.**

## Proof Strategy

The proof proceeds by contradiction:

1. Assume √2 = p/q where gcd(p,q) = 1
2. Square both sides: p² = 2q²
3. Show p must be even (since p² is even)
4. Substitute p = 2k, derive q² = 2k²
5. Show q must be even
6. Contradiction: both p and q are even, but gcd(p,q) = 1

## Theorem

For prior P, posterior Q (P restricted to zero-training-error solutions), and β = m-1:

$$\mathbb{E}_{w \sim Q}[h(w)] \leq \frac{\mathrm{KL}(Q \| P) + \ln \mathbb{E}_{w \sim P}[e^{\beta h(w)}]}{\beta}$$

## Key Insight

When Q is P restricted to the solution set S:

$$\mathrm{KL}(Q \| P) = \ln \frac{1}{P(S)} = \ln \frac{1}{\text{evidence}}$$

The KL divergence equals the negative log of the Bayesian evidence (prior probability of achieving zero training error).

## Proof Strategy

1. **Setup**: Define P (prior), Q (posterior restricted to solutions), h(w) (gen. error), β = m-1
2. **Invoke PAC-Bayes theorem** (admitted as external result)
3. **Compute KL(Q||P)**: Show it equals log(1/evidence)
4. **Interpret h(w)**: For solutions, h(w) is pure generalization error (train error = 0)
5. **Substitute**: Apply the bound with our specific choices

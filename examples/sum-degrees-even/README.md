## Theorem

**For any graph $G = (V, E)$, the sum of degrees of all vertices is even:**
\[
\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2|E|
\]

## Proof Strategy

The proof uses a simple but elegant counting argument:

1. **Definition**: Establish what a graph and vertex degree mean
2. **Observation**: Each edge contributes exactly 2 to the total degree sum (one for each endpoint)
3. **Calculation**: Since there are $|E|$ edges, the sum equals $2|E|$
4. **Conclusion**: $2|E|$ is even (being a multiple of 2)

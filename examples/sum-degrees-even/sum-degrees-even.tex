\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present a formal proof that for any graph $G = (V, E)$, the sum of degrees of all vertices is even. The key insight is that each edge contributes exactly 2 to the total degree sum (one for each endpoint), so the sum equals $2|E|$, which is even. The proof follows Lamport's structured proof format with explicit justifications for each step.

\section{Main Result}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:sum-degrees-even}
For any graph $G = (V, E)$, the sum of degrees of all vertices is even:
\[
\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2|E|
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

\begin{proofsteps}

\step{\textbf{Definition (Graph)}. A graph $G = (V, E)$ consists of a set $V$ of vertices and a set $E$ of edges, where each edge is an unordered pair of distinct vertices.}
\by{definition-expansion}
\label{step:0-def001}

\step{\textbf{Definition (Degree)}. For a vertex $v \in V$, the degree $\deg(v)$ is the number of edges incident to $v$.}
\by{definition-expansion; from \ref{step:0-def001}}
\label{step:0-def002}

\step{\textbf{Observation}. Each edge $\{u, v\} \in E$ contributes exactly 2 to the sum $\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v)$: one for vertex $u$ and one for vertex $v$.}
\by{definition-expansion; from \ref{step:0-def001}, \ref{step:0-def002}}
\label{step:1-obs001}

This follows directly from the definition of degree: when we count the degree of each vertex, each edge $\{u, v\}$ is counted once in $\deg(u)$ and once in $\deg(v)$, so it contributes a total of 2 to the sum.

\step{\textbf{Sum Calculation}. $\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2|E|$. This follows from \ref{step:1-obs001}: since each of the $|E|$ edges contributes exactly 2 to the sum, the total is $2|E|$.}
\by{algebraic-rewrite; from \ref{step:1-obs001}}
\label{step:1-sum001}

By \ref{step:1-obs001}, we have that each edge contributes 2 to the sum. Since there are $|E|$ edges in total, we obtain:
\[
\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = \sum_{\{u,v\} \in E} 2 = 2|E|
\]

\step{\textbf{Evenness}. Since $\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2|E|$ and $2|E|$ is even (being a multiple of 2), the sum of degrees is even.}
\by{modus-ponens; from \ref{step:1-sum001}}
\label{step:1-even001}

Any integer of the form $2k$ (where $k$ is an integer) is even by definition. Since $|E|$ is a nonnegative integer, $2|E|$ is even.

\step{\textbf{QED}. For any graph $G = (V, E)$, we have shown that $\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2|E|$, which is even. $\square$}
\by{qed; from \ref{step:1-even001}}
\label{step:1-qed001}

We have established that the sum of degrees equals $2|E|$, and since this is a multiple of 2, it is even. This completes the proof.

\end{proofsteps}
\end{proof}
